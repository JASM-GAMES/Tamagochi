TEXTURE MAPS

It is recommended to use the Blender files which already have the textures attached to the materials. An overview of the textures are provided below for the FBX files:

apart-emit.png - for phone and laptop screen emission, use uv-map2
apart-objects_*.png - for "...color.png" use uv-map0, for "...AO.png" use uv-map1
apart-objects_alpha.png - for the dish rack and mirror top trim, use uv-map2
tv-display.png - for the TV display, use uv-map2, can replace with your own image
scanlines.png - overlay over the TV display, change scale/tiling how you like
apart-objects_bathroom.png - only color, no AO map needed
apartment/bathroom - color and AO on separate maps, use uv-map0

To save texture memory, you can overlay the AO and color maps into one texture using photo editing software. However, apart-objects_*.png cannot be overlayed due to using different UV-maps.

Style-wise, it is not recommended to use texture filtering. Set it to "closest" or "nearest neighbor" or "point".
